features of python:
1) it is PL with dynamic type system - means -> any type check in PL happens at runtime instead of compile time
	- pros of this -> code is more readable and easier to write(less code written without type annotations) when there is no type clutter
					-> as there is no compile phase,lead to quicker turnaround when making software changes
2) huge emphasis on readability 
3) it is used as an interpreted language(RMAI- read more about it)
4) it is a multi-paradigm language as both OOP and Structural-oriented programming can be done through it. 
	-> also uses concepts of functional programming when working with groups of things

history of python:

1991 (1st release) ---- 
 descendent of ABC PL and written such that it would appeal to UNIX and C hackers
------------------
2000 (python 2.0) -----
 many new features like cycle detecting garbage collector and support for Unicode added
 development process became more transparent and community-backed through PEPs(python enhancements proposals)
-----------------
early development process called (Python 3000) or PY3K
2008 (python 3.0) -----
 major backward incompatible release
 but latest version of python 3.x are made backward compatible 2.7 & 2.6

some applications in which it is used -> Blender, Red hat Anaconda
Google App engine supports Python

current & future scope in python(search on google):
-stack overflow reports compare various PL
-IEEE spectrum programming language ranking
-TIOBE PL ranking

PEP 20 The Zen of Python - https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/
Alan Kay -
"Perspective is worth 80 IQ points."
Tony Hoare -
"I conclude that there are two ways of constructing a software design: One way is to make it so simple that there are obviously no deficiencies and the other way is to make it so complicated that there are no obvious deficiencies."

maintenance is expensive in software development, there python philosophy is mainly focused on readability of code

Why Python is different?
1) it was designed to be highly extensible - many functionality can be added on top of core python language
2) Embeddable scripting language
