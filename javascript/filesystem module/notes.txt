if the file system function returns the file descriptor (FD) for you then you need to close it explicitly by calling fs.close.
like:
	- fs.open
	
else(some functions in file system works like - open the file, operate on it, and then close it for you) when don't return (FD)
like:
	- fs.readFile
	- fs.writeFile
	- fs.appendFile
	
The streams returned by fs.createReadStream and fs.createWriteStream close after the stream ends but may be closed early. If you have paused a stream, you must call close on the stream to close the fd or resume the stream and let it end after emitting all its data.

----------------------------------
What is a File Descriptor?
It is an Integer value. 
Kernel maintains a File System table having the FD values stored
0 - stdin
1 - stdout
2 - stderr

whenever a file is opened then OS inserts a FD value to file system table. This value can be used get info about the opened file.
