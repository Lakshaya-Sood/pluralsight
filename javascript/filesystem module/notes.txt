if the file system function returns the file descriptor (FD) for you then you need to close it explicitly by calling fs.close.
like:
	- fs.open
	
else(some functions in file system works like - open the file, operate on it, and then close it for you) when don't return (FD)
like:
	- fs.readFile
	- fs.writeFile
	- fs.appendFile
	
The streams returned by fs.createReadStream and fs.createWriteStream close after the stream ends but may be closed early. If you have paused a stream, you must call close on the stream to close the fd or resume the stream and let it end after emitting all its data.


What is a File Descriptor?
It is an Integer value.
